                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hello everyone, My name is <strong>Sintayehu Mekonnen</strong>, and I'm <strong>a Developer.</strong>  I love Coding and Design!</p>
                <p>Here is my initial point about the computer. I never had the chance to learn and use Computers when I was my Hometown Country. Even if the difference between a laptop and a Desktop. However, learning about Computer Science was my dream. 
                        After I came to the USA in 2015, my first decision was joining the school. Thanks to GOD, before two years I, and my husband decided to start my Associate Degree at Georgia Piedmont Technical School, and I received my Associate from them. </p>
                    <p>In the meantime, one of my friends told me about programming courses, and I started teaching myself online for some basic concepts about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I became more interested and continue learning. 
                      I learned 10 weeks of face-to-face Introduction to Web Development course.</p>

                    <p>I was very excited when I created my first website, and I remember how many days I spent when I tried to put my image on my website. I surprised when I see my work right now. Today, I was learning more programming Languages and started doing more projects. 
                         </p>
                    <p>Right now, I'm a <em>Tech Talent South Atlant </em>Full Time <strong>Code Immersion and Web Design</strong> class student. I believe I learn every single day from each class. I'm open-minded, ready to learn new skills from any environment, and like a collaborative work.</p>
